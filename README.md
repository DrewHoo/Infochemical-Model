# Infochemical-Model
A Repast Simphony model based on the concept of digital infochemicals.
The object of this project is to create an Agent-Based Model in which agents use digital infochemicals to communicate.
The design borrows heavily from Nick Collier's Heatbugs model which is one of the Repast Simphony example models.
